  <description brief="Messages for (camera) view controllers">
     view_controller_msgs is intended to contain common messages
     that can be used to issue commands to a view controller in a
     visualization program (such as rviz).

     This package should be considered experimental/unstable during the 
     Groovy release cycle.
